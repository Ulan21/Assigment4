This Java program is a simple weather information retrieval tool. It allows a user to input a city name, fetches weather data for that city from an external weather API (OpenWeatherMap), and then displays various weather details for the specified location. 
method  fetchWeather retrieves weather data for a specified city.It reads the user's input for the city name using the Scanner class.Constructs an API URL by appending the user-specified city and an API key to the OpenWeatherMap API URL.
Establishes an HTTP connection to the API using HttpURLConnection.Checks the HTTP response code. If it's successful (HTTP_OK, status code 200), the code reads the API response as a JSON string and returns it. If not, it throws an IOException with an error message.This method is responsible for parsing the weather data obtained from fetchWeather and displaying specific weather information.The main method is the entry point of the program.
It calls the printCurrentWeather method to retrieve and display the current weather information for the city entered by the user.Temperature values obtained from the API response are converted from Kelvin to Celsius, which is a common practice when working with weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
